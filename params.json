Spatial Data Integrator or SDI) is an ETL with geospatial capabilities.\r\n\r\nLikewise regular TOS components, there are basically three sorts of Geo components: input, output and transform components. Input and output components read features from and write feature to datastores, respectively. Transform components read features from their input flows, possibly transform those features, and write features to their output flows. The term transform is to be taken loosely here as it represents any sort of operation.\r\n\r\nSpatial components are using GeoTools and Java Topology Suite for read/write GIS formats and feature manipulation. Experimental works have been done to embed uDig to display GIS datasets and Sextante library to add RASTER processing.\r\n\r\n### News & events\r\n\r\n### Use cases\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n","tagline":"ETL GIS GEOSPATIAL","google":""}
